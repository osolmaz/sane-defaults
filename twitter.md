## Change Twitter feed to "Latest Tweets" mode

Click the "sparkles icon" at the top of your feed. (The icon is not descriptive and can be considered a dark pattern.)

Click `See latest Tweets instead`.

Notice that it says `You'll be switched back Home after you've been away for a while`. Make sure that you occasionally check the top of your feed so that it says `Latest Tweets` instead of `Home`. This is a dark pattern. Twitter wants to make sure that people eventually converge to algorithmic feeds.

## Block toxic accounts

Navigate to the toxic account you want to block. Click the three-dots icon.

Click `Block @....`.

Confirm that you want to block the account. From this point on, you will not be shown tweets or retweets from this account.

## Mute toxic words

Sometimes, it is not enough to just block accounts, as the toxic memes still creep into your feed. In that case, you may want to block certain keywords out of your feed. Twitter allows this functionality with "Muted keywords". When you mute a keyword, tweets including it will not show up in your feed.

Unfortunately, Twitter has hid the link to this feature. This is a dark pattern. You can reach the settings page by [clicking this link](https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords).

Then, click the plus icon.

In the next screen, simply enter the keyword that you want to mute. Don't forget to set the most strict settings. Twitter will by default select "From people you don't follow" instead of "From anyone".

Click Save to save your setting. You will never see that word again in your feed.
