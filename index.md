Controlling the consumption of information is essential to preserving individual sovereignty. Ad-blocking and abstinence from algorithmic feeds are now a necessity, to prevent platforms from controlling our minds and affecting our wellbeing.

A **sane default** is a concept in software engineering, meaning *a default setting chosen to ensure an optimal experience*, which is to be reproduced across multiple machines. Unfortunately, the default settings on most digital platforms today **don't** maximize your wellbeing, but are rather configured to **hook you in**. Platforms also use [dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) to nudge you into unhealthy browsing habits. We point these out wherever they show up.

We present below a comprehensive list of sane defaults for every digital platform, to help you take back control.
