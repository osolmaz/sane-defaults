Controlling the information you consume is essential to preserving your individual sovereignty. Ad-blocking and abstinence from algorithmic feeds became a necessity in the digital age. Don't let them control your dopamine!

A **sane default** is a concept in software engineering which means a default setting that is chosen to ensure an optimal experience, and which is to be reproduced across multiple machines. Unfortunately, the default settings on most digital platforms today **don't** maximize your wellbeing, but are rather configured to **hook you in**.

Platforms also use [dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) to nudge you into unhealthy browsing habits. We point these out wherever they show up.

Below is a comprehensive list of sane defaults for every digital platform, to help you take back control.
