As a social media platform, Instagram has high toxicity. In terms of user control, Instagram **does not allow** switching to non-algorithmic feeds. Instagram allows disabling notifications and blocking accounts.

Below are the recommendations for using Instagram.

## Home Tab

The Home Tab features two algorithmic feeds:

1. The main feed, which features the posts from your following in the last few days.
2. `Suggested Posts`, begins where the main feed ends.

⚠️ **Dark pattern: Instagram does not allow for switching the main feed to a non-algorithmic mode.** ⚠️

⚠️ **Dark pattern: Instagram does not allow for switching off `Suggested Posts`. Avoid it manually, if you can.** ⚠️


## Explore Tab

The Explore Tab features an algorithmic fead that displays a grid of visual content from user posts.
